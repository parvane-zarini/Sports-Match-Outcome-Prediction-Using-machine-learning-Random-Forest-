#  Sports Match Outcome Prediction  
**Multi-Sport ML Forecasting System**

An end‑to‑end intelligence platform for predicting match outcomes across **12 different sports**, powered by advanced machine‑learning models and a streamlined web interface.

---

##  Overview

This system delivers **high‑accuracy multi-sport outcome forecasting** using a hybrid ensemble of **Random Forest**, **XGBoost**, and **Deep Neural Networks**.  
It processes historical match data, contextual statistics, and engineered temporal features to generate dynamic, data‑driven predictions.

Users can select a sport, pick two teams, and instantly receive the model’s predicted winner via a clean, interactive web UI.
